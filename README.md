just a repo for my bash.rc and vim stuff... I had them on dropbox but git will prolly work better.

It has a great few mods to vim that give better colors and easier tab handling. 
It includes ruby.vim, perl.vim, js.vim, cucumber.vim and a few more (not all loaded).
Originally I borrewed this from Andr√© Cassimro, didn't change much on the base.
cucumber.vim has a small change on the loading of step definitions, it opens them on a tab instead of replacing current file.
the bash stuff is probably tied o my work.
